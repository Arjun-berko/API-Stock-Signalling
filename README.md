## Overview
A small consultancy who is currently delivering client work for a major bank wants to monitor the Tesla stock price. Once the stock falls below a certain price, they want to be immediately notified so that they can be purchase Tesla stock. 
## Goal
Write a real time application that monitors the price then notifies the user when the price falls below Â£194.50 GBP.
## Brief
To do this, the client has recommended using a popular automation website called IFTTT: https://ifttt.com/. They are willing to use a different provider or solution (use those consultancy skills!) if you believe there is a better option.
### IFTTT Applet
A IFTTT Applet consists of two parts: a trigger and an action.

## Main Considerations
- Choose an automation approach. Are you planning on using IFTTT or another approach?
- What API are you going to use?
